### Cognitive Synergy Mechanisms

The multiscale nature of skin and cosmeceutical action requires cognitive synergy between:

1. **Bottom-up Processing**: Molecular interactions → cellular effects → tissue changes
2. **Top-down Processing**: Desired outcomes → tissue requirements → cellular targets → molecular design
3. **Lateral Processing**: Cross-scale interactions and feedback loops

## INCI-Driven Search Space Reduction

### Algorithmic Approach

1. **INCI Parsing**: Extract ingredient lists from product formulations
2. **Concentration Estimation**: Infer concentration ranges from INCI ordering
3. **Subset Filtering**: Identify formulations whose INCI lists are subsets of target products
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Filter based on concentration limits and safety restrictions

### Implementation Strategy

```python
class INCISearchSpaceReducer:
    def __init__(self, atomspace):
        self.atomspace = atomspace
        self.inci_database = {}
        self.regulatory_limits = {}
    
    def parse_inci_list(self, inci_string):
        """Parse INCI ingredient list and estimate concentrations"""
        pass
    
    def filter_formulation_space(self, target_inci, constraints):
        """Reduce search space based on INCI constraints"""
        pass
    
    def check_regulatory_compliance(self, formulation):
        """Verify formulation meets regulatory requirements"""
        pass
```
