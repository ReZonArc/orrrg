```python
# Optimize specific scenarios
scenarios = [
    {
        'conditions': ['wrinkles', 'firmness', 'brightness'],
        'skin_types': ['mature', 'normal'],
        'budgets': [2500, 5000],
        'preferences': [['premium', 'luxury'], ['clinical', 'proven']]
    }
]

# Generate targeted formulations
for scenario in scenarios:
    for conditions in [scenario['conditions']]:
        for skin_type in scenario['skin_types']:
            for budget in scenario['budgets']:
                for preferences in scenario['preferences']:
                    formulation = meta_optimizer.optimizer.optimize_formulation(
                        target_concerns=conditions,
                        skin_type=skin_type,
                        budget=budget,
                        preferences=preferences
