# Meta-Optimization Strategy Guide

## Overview

The Meta-Optimization Strategy is a revolutionary approach to cosmeceutical formulation design that generates optimal formulations for every possible condition and treatment combination. It uses recursive optimization techniques, adaptive strategy selection, and continuous learning to provide comprehensive coverage of the formulation space.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Coverage
- **105 condition-treatment combinations** across 7 major skin concerns
- **Multi-severity levels**: mild, moderate, severe
- **All skin types**: normal, dry, oily, combination, sensitive
- **Budget-aware optimization**: adaptive budget ranges for different complexities

### ðŸ§  Adaptive Strategy Selection
- **8 optimization strategies** available: genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, hybrid multi-objective, recursive decomposition, adaptive search
- **Problem-aware selection**: strategy chosen based on condition complexity, treatment count, skin sensitivity, and severity
- **Performance-based adaptation**: strategies are continuously evaluated and improved

### ðŸ”„ Recursive Exploration
- **Multi-depth formulation exploration**: recursively explores variations when initial solutions are suboptimal
- **Request variation generation**: automatically generates budget, ingredient count, and pH variations
- **Solution deduplication**: intelligent removal of duplicate formulations
- **Cache-aware optimization**: reuses successful patterns for similar requests

### ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Learning
- **Strategy performance tracking**: monitors success rates, quality scores, and computation times
- **Adaptive learning rates**: adjusts strategy selection based on historical performance
- **Trend analysis**: tracks performance over time to identify improving or declining strategies

## Architecture

### Core Components

```python
class MetaOptimizationStrategy:
    """
    Main meta-optimization controller that orchestrates the entire process
    """
    
    def __init__(self, database, cache_size=10000, max_recursive_depth=3):
        self.database = database                    # Hypergredient database
        self.base_optimizer = FormulationOptimizer  # Base optimization engine
        self.cache = MetaOptimizationCache         # Pattern caching system
        self.strategy_performance = {}             # Performance tracking
        self.condition_treatment_mapping = {}      # Comprehensive mapping
```

### Condition-Treatment Mapping

The system automatically generates comprehensive mappings covering:

```python
condition_categories = {
    'aging': ['anti_aging', 'wrinkles', 'fine_lines', 'firmness', 'elasticity'],
    'pigmentation': ['hyperpigmentation', 'dark_spots', 'melasma', 'age_spots', 'brightness'],
    'acne': ['acne', 'blackheads', 'whiteheads', 'oily_skin', 'pores'],
    'sensitivity': ['sensitive_skin', 'redness', 'inflammation', 'irritation'],
    'dryness': ['dryness', 'hydration', 'barrier_repair', 'flaking'],
    'texture': ['texture', 'roughness', 'smoothness', 'refinement'],
    'dullness': ['dullness', 'radiance', 'glow', 'luminosity']
}
```

### Strategy Selection Logic

```python
def select_optimal_strategy(self, pair: ConditionTreatmentPair, recursive_depth: int = 0):
    complexity = pair.complexity_score
    treatment_count = len(pair.treatments)
    is_sensitive = pair.skin_type == 'sensitive'
    is_severe = pair.severity == 'severe'
    
    if complexity > 6 and treatment_count > 4:
        return OptimizationStrategy.RECURSIVE_DECOMPOSITION
    elif is_sensitive and is_severe:
        return OptimizationStrategy.ADAPTIVE_SEARCH
    elif treatment_count > 3:
        return OptimizationStrategy.HYBRID_MULTI_OBJECTIVE
    # ... additional logic
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from cheminformatics.hypergredient import (
    MetaOptimizationStrategy, create_hypergredient_database
)

# Initialize system
db = create_hypergredient_database()
meta_optimizer = MetaOptimizationStrategy(db, cache_size=1000)

# Run comprehensive optimization
results = meta_optimizer.optimize_all_conditions(max_solutions_per_condition=3)

# Process results
for condition, condition_results in results.items():
    print(f"Condition: {condition}")
    for result in condition_results:
        print(f"  Quality: {result.quality_score:.1f}/10")
        print(f"  Strategy: {result.optimization_strategy.value}")
```

### Recursive Exploration

```python
from cheminformatics.hypergredient import FormulationRequest

# Create challenging request
request = FormulationRequest(
    target_concerns=['anti_aging', 'hyperpigmentation'],
    skin_type='sensitive',
    budget=1200.0,
    excluded_ingredients=['tretinoin', 'hydroquinone'],
    max_ingredients=6
)

# Use recursive exploration
solutions = meta_optimizer.recursive_formulation_exploration(
    request, max_depth=3
)

print(f"Found {len(solutions)} optimized solutions")
for solution in solutions:
    print(f"Score: {solution.total_score:.1f}, Cost: R{solution.cost:.2f}")
```

### Custom Strategy Selection

```python
from cheminformatics.hypergredient import ConditionTreatmentPair

# Define custom condition
custom_pair = ConditionTreatmentPair(
    condition='custom_treatment',
    treatments=['anti_aging', 'acne', 'hydration'],
    severity='severe',
    skin_type='sensitive',
    complexity_score=6.5
)

# Get recommended strategy
strategy = meta_optimizer.select_optimal_strategy(custom_pair)
print(f"Recommended strategy: {strategy.value}")
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get performance report
report = meta_optimizer.get_optimization_report()

print("Strategy Performance:")
for strategy, perf in report['strategy_performance'].items():
    print(f"  {strategy}: {perf['success_rate']:.1%} success, "
          f"{perf['average_quality']:.1f} avg quality")
```

### Export Formulation Library

```python
# Export comprehensive library
library = meta_optimizer.export_formulation_library(
    results, 
    output_path="complete_formulation_library.json"
)

print(f"Exported {library['metadata']['total_formulations']} formulations")
```

   - Adjust strategy selection thresholds

2. **Poor Performance**
   - Reduce recursive depth for faster optimization
