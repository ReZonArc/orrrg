# OpenCog Multiscale Constraint Optimization for Cosmeceutical Formulation

## Overview

This system implements a groundbreaking synthesis between advanced cognitive architectures and practical formulation science, leveraging OpenCog features (AtomSpace, PLN, MOSES, ECAN) for next-generation cosmeceutical design.

## Architecture Components

### 1. INCI-Driven Search Space Reduction

The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system provides a standardized framework for ingredient identification and regulatory compliance. Our implementation includes:

#### Key Features:
- **INCI List Parsing**: Automated extraction and analysis of ingredient lists from trade name products
- **Concentration Estimation**: Algorithm to estimate absolute concentrations from INCI ordering and regulatory constraints
- **Search Space Pruning**: Filtering formulation space to subsets with compatible INCI profiles
- **Regulatory Validation**: Real-time checking against regional concentration limits

#### Implementation:
```python
class INCISearchSpaceReducer:
    def parse_inci_list(self, inci_string: str) -> List[IngredientInfo]
    def estimate_concentrations(self, ingredients: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]
    def reduce_search_space(self, target_profile: Dict) -> List[FormulationCandidate]
    def validate_regulatory_compliance(self, formulation: Formulation, region: str) -> bool
```

### 2. Adaptive Attention Allocation System

Inspired by OpenCog's ECAN (Economic Attention Network), this system manages computational resources by focusing on promising formulation subspaces.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment**: Automatic reallocation based on formulation performance
- **Multi-objective Balancing**: Simultaneous optimization of efficacy, safety, cost, and stability
- **Attention Economy**: STI/LTI-inspired metrics for ingredient and interaction prioritization
- **Cognitive Synergy**: Integration with PLN reasoning for intelligent resource allocation

#### Implementation:
```python
class AttentionAllocationManager:
    def allocate_attention(self, nodes: List[AtomNode]) -> Dict[AtomNode, float]
    def update_attention_values(self, performance_feedback: Dict) -> None
    def focus_computational_resources(self, subspace: FormulationSubspace) -> None
    def implement_attention_decay(self, time_step: float) -> None
```

### 3. Multiscale Constraint Optimization Engine

This engine operates across multiple biological scales (molecular, cellular, tissue, organ) to achieve optimal formulation design.

#### Biological Scale Integration:
1. **Molecular Scale**: Individual ingredient properties, interactions, stability
2. **Cellular Scale**: Penetration, uptake, cellular response mechanisms
3. **Tissue Scale**: Skin barrier function, hydration, anti-aging effects
4. **Organ Scale**: Overall skin health, sensory properties, safety profile

#### Optimization Framework:
- **Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm**: MOSES-inspired genetic programming
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: PLN-based logical reasoning for regulatory compliance
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Probabilistic reasoning for incomplete data scenarios
- **Emergent Property Calculation**: Bottom-up computation of system-level effects

#### Implementation:
```python
class MultiscaleConstraintOptimizer:
    def optimize_formulation(self, objectives: List[Objective], constraints: List[Constraint]) -> Formulation
    def evaluate_multiscale_properties(self, formulation: Formulation) -> MultiscaleProfile
    def handle_constraint_conflicts(self, conflicts: List[Constraint]) -> Resolution
    def compute_emergent_properties(self, molecular_interactions: Dict) -> SystemProperties
```
