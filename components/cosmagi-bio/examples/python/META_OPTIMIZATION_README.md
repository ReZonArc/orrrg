# Optimize single condition
result = meta_optimizer.optimize_single_condition(profile)

# Generate formulation library
library = meta_optimizer.generate_comprehensive_library(max_conditions=100)

# Get optimization insights
insights = meta_optimizer.get_optimization_insights()
```

```python
# Generate all possible combinations
all_profiles = meta_optimizer.generate_all_condition_profiles()
