**Key Features**:
- SQLite database persistence
- Thread-safe operations with RLock
- Automatic indexing for performance
- Comprehensive metadata support
- Unique ID generation to prevent conflicts

### 2. Universal Learning Framework ✅ COMPLETE  
**File**: `learning_framework.py` (verified) + `universal_systems.py`

The LearningFramework was already complete with all required components:
- **ReinforcementLearner()**: Q-learning with epsilon-greedy policy
- **SupervisedLearner()**: Pattern recognition and classification
- **UnsupervisedLearner()**: Clustering and unsupervised analysis  
- **MetaLearner()**: Strategy optimization and performance tuning

**Key Features**:
- Multi-modal learning support
- Adaptive learning rate adjustment
- Experience-based improvement
- Performance trend analysis
- Strategy recommendation system

### 3. Universal Decision Engine ✅ NEW IMPLEMENTATION
**File**: `decision_engine.py` (new) + `universal_systems.py`

Completely new implementation of the DecisionEngine with all required components:
- **GoalManager()**: Goal creation, tracking, and progress monitoring
- **ConstraintHandler()**: Constraint validation and violation detection
- **RiskAssessor()**: Risk evaluation with mitigation strategies
- **AdaptivePlanner()**: Plan creation, adaptation, and contingency planning

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive decision-making framework
- Multi-criteria analysis (goals, constraints, risks)
- Adaptive planning with contingency support
- Real-time decision confidence scoring
- Automated plan adaptation based on feedback

## Interface Compliance

The implementation provides the exact interface specified in the issue:

```python
# Required: Universal memory system
memory_system = PersistentMemorySystem(
    vector_store=VectorStore(),
    knowledge_graph=KnowledgeGraph(),
    experience_db=ExperienceDatabase(),
    context_memory=ContextMemory()
)

# Required: Universal learning framework
learning_framework = LearningFramework(
    reinforcement_learner=ReinforcementLearner(),
    supervised_learner=SupervisedLearner(),
    unsupervised_learner=UnsupervisedLearner(),
    meta_learner=MetaLearner()
)

# Required: Universal decision engine
decision_engine = DecisionEngine(
    goal_manager=GoalManager(),
    constraint_handler=ConstraintHandler(),
    risk_assessor=RiskAssessor(),
    adaptive_planner=AdaptivePlanner()
)
```

## Testing & Validation

## Integration Guide

### For Existing Agents
Minimal changes required to integrate:

```python
from models.universal_systems import (
    create_universal_memory_system,
    create_universal_learning_framework,
    create_universal_decision_engine
)

class YourAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        # Add these three lines to existing agents
        self.memory_system = create_universal_memory_system(agent_id)
        self.learning_framework = create_universal_learning_framework(agent_id)
        self.decision_engine = create_universal_decision_engine(agent_id)
```

### Benefits for Agents
