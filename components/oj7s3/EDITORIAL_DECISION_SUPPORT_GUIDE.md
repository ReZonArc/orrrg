### For Developers

1. **API Integration**:
   ```python
   # Example API call for decision recommendation
   import requests
   
   data = {
       'submission_id': 'MS-2024-001',
       'manuscript_data': {...},
       'reviews_data': [...],
       'context_data': {...}
   }
   
   response = requests.post(
       'http://localhost:8005/api/v1/decision/recommend',
       json=data
   )
   
   recommendation = response.json()
   ```

2. **Plugin Hooks**:
   - `EditorAction::recordDecision` - Captures editorial decisions
   - `ReviewAssignmentDAO::getReviewsForSubmission` - Enhances review data

### OJS Configuration
Add to `config.inc.php`:
```php
[skz]
decision_engine_url = "http://localhost:8005"
enable_ai_recommendations = On
```

### Service Configuration
The decision support service can be configured via environment variables or configuration files:

- `DECISION_ENGINE_PORT` - Port for the service (default: 8005)
- `DATABASE_PATH` - Path to SQLite audit database
- `QUALITY_THRESHOLD` - Minimum quality score for acceptance
- `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` - Minimum confidence for recommendations
