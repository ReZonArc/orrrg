## ðŸ“‹ CURRENT MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REPLACE

### 1. Basic Reviewer Matching (Lines 130-150)
```python
async def match_reviewers(self, manuscript: ManuscriptProfile, available_reviewers: List[ReviewerProfile], num_matches: int = 3):
    # Simplified scoring without ML
    match_scores = []
    for reviewer in available_reviewers:
        if await self._check_eligibility(manuscript, reviewer):
            match_score = await self._calculate_match_score(manuscript, reviewer)
            match_scores.append(match_score)
    
    match_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x.match_score, reverse=True)
    return match_scores[:num_matches]
```

### 2. Limited Semantic Analysis
```python
# Current implementation lacks:
# - Semantic similarity using sentence transformers
# - Multi-dimensional optimization algorithms
# - Historical performance analysis
# - Global assignment optimization
```
