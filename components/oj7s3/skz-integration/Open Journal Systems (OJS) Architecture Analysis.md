# Open Journal Systems (OJS) Architecture Analysis

## System Overview

Open Journal Systems (OJS) is a PHP-based scholarly publishing platform developed by the Public Knowledge Project (PKP). It follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and is designed for maintainability, flexibility, and robustness.

## Directory Structure

### Core Components

- **`classes/`** - Model classes representing system entities
  - `journal/` - Journal-related models (Journal, Section)
  - `article/` - Article and publication models
  - `user/` - User management models
  - `submission/` - Submission workflow models
  - `issue/` - Issue management models
  - `payment/` - Payment processing models

- **`controllers/`** - Controller classes handling user requests
  - `api/` - API endpoint controllers
  - `grid/` - Grid-based UI controllers
  - Various specialized controllers for different features

- **`templates/`** - Smarty template files for UI rendering
  - `frontend/` - Public-facing templates
  - `controllers/` - Admin interface templates
  - `authorDashboard/` - Author-specific templates

- **`api/v1/`** - RESTful API endpoints
  - `submissions/` - Submission management API
  - `users/` - User management API
  - `contexts/` - Journal context API
  - `issues/` - Issue management API
  - `announcements/` - Announcement API

### Key Features Identified

1. **Multi-journal Support** - Single installation can host multiple journals
2. **Role-based Access Control** - Authors, reviewers, editors, administrators
3. **Submission Workflow** - Complete manuscript submission and review process
4. **Issue Management** - Publication scheduling and organization
5. **Payment Integration** - Subscription and fee processing
6. **Internationalization** - Multi-language support
7. **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible functionality

## Database Architecture

The system uses Data Access Objects (DAOs) for database interaction:
- `JournalDAO` - Journal management
- `ArticleDAO` - Article/submission management
- `UserDAO` - User management
- `SectionDAO` - Journal section management

## API Structure

The existing API (v1) provides endpoints for:
- Submission management (`/api/v1/submissions`)
- User management (`/api/v1/users`)
- Context/Journal management (`/api/v1/contexts`)
- Issue management (`/api/v1/issues`)
- Statistics (`/api/v1/stats`)

## Current Frontend Technology

- **Template Engine**: Smarty templates
- **JavaScript**: jQuery-based interactions
- **CSS**: Traditional CSS with some responsive design
- **UI Framework**: Custom grid-based interface

## Integration Points for New Web Interface

1. **API Layer**: Existing REST API can be extended/enhanced
2. **Authentication**: Session-based authentication system
3. **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL with established schema
4. **File Management**: Existing file upload/management system
5. **Permissions**: Role-based access control system

## Recommended Architecture for New Interface

### Frontend (React-based)
- Modern React application with TypeScript
- Material-UI or similar component library
- Redux/Context for state management
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend Integration
- Extend existing PHP API endpoints
- Add new endpoints for chatbot functionality
- Maintain compatibility with existing OJS core
- Add WebSocket support for real-time features

### Chatbot System
- Node.js/Python microservice for AI processing
- Integration with OpenAI API for natural language processing
- Context-aware responses based on OJS data
- Multiple specialized agents for different use cases

## Security Considerations

- Maintain existing authentication mechanisms
- Implement proper API rate limiting
- Secure chatbot interactions
- Protect sensitive journal data
- CSRF protection for API endpoints

## Performance Considerations

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize API responses
- Use lazy loading for large datasets
- Implement proper database indexing
- Consider CDN for static assets

## Next Steps

1. Design modern UI/UX for the web interface
2. Plan chatbot agent capabilities and conversation flows
3. Create API specifications for frontend-backend communication
4. Set up development environment with React and backend services
