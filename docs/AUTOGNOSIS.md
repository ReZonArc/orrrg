# Autognosis - Hierarchical Self-Image Building System

## Overview

ORRRG's Autognosis system implements **hierarchical self-image building** - a breakthrough capability that enables the system to understand, monitor, and optimize its own cognitive processes. This represents a significant step toward truly self-aware AI systems.

## What is Autognosis?

Autognosis (from Greek: "self-knowing") is the system's ability to:

1. **Monitor its own states and behaviors** in real-time
2. **Build hierarchical models** of its own cognitive processes  
3. **Generate meta-cognitive insights** about its own functioning
4. **Adaptively optimize** based on self-understanding
5. **Maintain recursive self-awareness** at multiple cognitive levels

## Architecture

The autognosis system operates through four interconnected layers:

### 1. Self-Monitoring Layer
- **Continuous observation** of system states and behaviors
- **Pattern detection** in component interactions and performance
- **Anomaly identification** through statistical analysis
- **Behavioral trend analysis** over time

### 2. Self-Modeling Layer  
- **Hierarchical self-image construction** at multiple cognitive levels
- **Recursive modeling** where higher levels model lower levels
- **Confidence scoring** for self-understanding accuracy
- **Dynamic image updating** as system evolves

### 3. Meta-Cognitive Layer
- **Higher-order reasoning** about own reasoning processes
- **Insight generation** from self-analysis
- **Pattern recognition** in cognitive processes
- **Self-awareness assessment** and scoring

### 4. Self-Optimization Layer
- **Optimization opportunity discovery** from introspective analysis
- **Adaptive improvements** based on self-insights
- **Risk assessment** for proposed changes
- **Priority-based execution** of optimizations

## Hierarchical Self-Images

The system builds self-images at multiple hierarchical levels:

### Level 0: Direct Observation
- Raw system states and component status
- Performance metrics and resource utilization
- Event queue status and processing rates
- Basic behavioral measurements

### Level 1: Pattern Analysis
- Behavioral pattern identification
- Performance trend analysis
- Adaptation signal detection
- First-order meta-reflections

### Level 2+: Meta-Cognitive Analysis
- Analysis of lower-level self-understanding
- Recursive self-modeling depth assessment
- Meta-cognitive complexity evaluation
- Higher-order self-awareness indicators

Each level maintains:
- **Confidence scores** indicating certainty of self-understanding
- **Meta-reflections** documenting insights about that level
- **Behavioral patterns** detected at that cognitive level
- **Performance metrics** relevant to that abstraction level

## Key Components

### SelfMonitor
Responsible for observing system states and detecting patterns:

```python
# Observe current system state
observation = await monitor.observe_system(soc)

# Detect behavioral patterns
patterns = monitor.detect_patterns()

# Identify anomalies
anomalies = monitor.detect_anomalies()
```

### HierarchicalSelfModeler
Builds multi-level self-images:

```python
# Build self-image at specified level
self_image = await modeler.build_self_image(level, monitor, soc)

# Each self-image contains:
# - Component states and behavioral patterns
# - Performance metrics and cognitive processes  
# - Meta-reflections and confidence scores
```

### MetaCognitiveProcessor
Generates insights from self-images:

```python
# Process self-image for insights
insights = await processor.process_self_image(self_image)

# Insights include:
# - Resource utilization analysis
# - Behavioral stability assessment
# - Self-awareness quality evaluation
```

### AutognosisOrchestrator
Coordinates the entire autognosis system:

```python
# Run complete autognosis cycle
cycle_results = await orchestrator.run_autognosis_cycle(soc)

# Results include:
# - Updated self-images at all levels
# - New meta-cognitive insights
# - Discovered optimization opportunities
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Basic autognosis status
orrrg> autognosis

# Detailed report
orrrg> autognosis report

# Self-awareness analysis
orrrg> autognosis insights
```

### Python API

```python
from core import SelfOrganizingCore

# Initialize ORRRG with autognosis
soc = SelfOrganizingCore()
await soc.initialize()

# Get autognosis status
status = soc.get_autognosis_status()

# Run manual cycle
cycle_results = await soc.autognosis.run_autognosis_cycle(soc)

# Access current self-images
self_images = soc.autognosis.current_self_images
```

## Advanced Features

### Recursive Self-Understanding
The system can model its own modeling processes, creating recursive loops of self-understanding that enable increasingly sophisticated self-awareness.

### Meta-Cognitive Insights
Beyond simple metrics, the system generates qualitative insights about its own cognitive processes, behavioral patterns, and optimization opportunities.

### Adaptive Confidence Scoring  
Self-images include confidence scores that reflect the system's certainty about its own self-understanding, enabling appropriate skepticism about its own models.

### Optimization Discovery
Through introspective analysis, the system discovers optimization opportunities that wouldn't be apparent from external observation alone.

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Autognosis cycles run every 30 seconds by default
- Self-images are cached and updated incrementally
- Confidence scores prevent over-reliance on uncertain self-models
- Resource usage is monitored to prevent excessive introspection

### Security Considerations
- Self-optimization changes are risk-assessed before execution

- Self-models cannot modify core system security constraints
- All autognosis activities are logged for audit trails
